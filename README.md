<h1>Hello, fellow robotics learners</h1>
For those of us who are on a budget, have brain-sized balls (or ball-sized brains, depending on POV),
and/or plan to control the robot from an embedded system (or any combination thereof), I've been trying to implement some of the MATLAB functionality in C.<br>
I'ts work in progress, dudes. Forward and reverse kinematics will be coming any day now.<br>
Feel free to contribute, but don't improve matrix_mul() unless you really, really, really, really know what you're doing - I pulled my hair out to make that beast work.

To compile, type make at the $ prompt<br>
$ make
