<h1>Hello, fellow robotics learners</h1>
For those of us who are on a budget, have big balls, or plan to control the robot from an embedded system (or any combination thereof), I've been trying to implement some of the MATLAB functionality in C.<br>
I'ts work in progress. Forward and reverse kinematics will be coming.<br>
Feel free to contribute, but don't touch matrix_mul() - I pulled my hair out to make that beast work.

To compile, type make at the $ prompt<br>
$ make
