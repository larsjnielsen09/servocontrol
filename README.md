<h1>Hello, fellow learners</h1>
For thos of us who are on a budget, or plan to control the robot from an embedded system, I've been trying to implement some of the MATLAB functionality in C.
I'ts work in progress.
Feel free to contribute, but don't touch matrix_mul() - I pulled my hair out to make that thing work.

To compile, type make at the $ prompt<br>
$ make
