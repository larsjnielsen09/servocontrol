For those of us who are on a budget, have brain-sized balls (or ball-sized brains, depending on POV), and/or plan to control the robot from an embedded system (or any combination thereof), I've been trying to implement some of the MATLAB functionality in C\&.
.br
 I'ts work in progress, dudes\&. Forward and reverse kinematics will be coming any day now\&.
.br
 Feel free to contribute, but don't improve \fBmatrix_mul()\fP unless you really, really, really, really know what you're doing - I pulled my hair out to make that beast work\&.

To compile, type make at the $ prompt
