For those of us who are on a budget, have big balls, or plan to control the robot from an embedded system (or any combination thereof), I've been trying to implement some of the MATLAB functionality in C\&.

 I'ts work in progress\&. Forward and reverse kinematics will be coming\&.
.br
 Feel free to contribute, but don't touch \fBmatrix_mul()\fP - I pulled my hair out to make that beast work\&.

To compile, type make at the $ prompt

 $ make
