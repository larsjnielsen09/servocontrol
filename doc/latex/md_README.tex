\section*{Hello, fellow robotics learners}

For those of us who are on a budget, have brain-\/sized balls (or ball-\/sized brains, depending on P\+OV), and/or plan to control the robot from an embedded system (or any combination thereof), I\textquotesingle{}ve been trying to implement some of the M\+A\+T\+L\+AB functionality in C.~\newline
 I\textquotesingle{}ts work in progress, dudes. Forward and reverse kinematics will be coming any day now.~\newline
 Feel free to contribute, but don\textquotesingle{}t improve \hyperlink{matrix_8c_a1e8d8c0421f716763d5bbb5c39af0e5b}{matrix\+\_\+mul()} unless you really, really, really, really know what you\textquotesingle{}re doing -\/ I pulled my hair out to make that beast work.

To compile, type make at the \$ prompt~\newline
